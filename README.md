# FAKE-REST-API

This repo is a fast alternative  when you need some fake data.  It's great for development environments, tutorials, faking a server, sharing code examples, jokes, etc 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Node JS
```

### Installing

```
npm intall
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running fake rest apis

Launch **01-hello-world.js** execute :

```
node 01-hello-world.js
```

If no errors in log, go to your browser and type :

```
http://localhost:8080/
```

And you get

```

Analogously:

| Rest example        | node launch           | rest endpoint  |	description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:|
| 01-hello-world.js      | node 01-hello-world.js | http://localhost:8080/ |  simple hello word 
| 02-quote.js      | node 02-quote.js | http://localhost:8080/quotes | javascript object to json, simple crud
| 03-cors-companies.js      | node 03-cors-companies.js | http://localhost:8080/companies | using cors in node
